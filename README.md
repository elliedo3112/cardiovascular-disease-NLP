# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient data. By identifying key indicators of cardiovascular conditions, the models aim to assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

- **Performance:**
  - Achieved over **70% accuracy** using cross-validation
  - Implemented **L2 regularization** to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting

## Key Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - `scikit-learn`: Model development, evaluation, and cross-validation
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization

## Project Objectives

1. **Develop Predictive Models:** Build models to identify the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
2. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for effective feature engineering.
3. **Model Comparison:** Evaluate and compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms.
4. **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure model stability and prevent overfitting.
5. **Feature Analysis:** Analyze key features that significantly influence cardiovascular health.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises anonymized patient records with the following features:

- **Age**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol Levels**
- **Smoking Status**
